-- This is a seed file for development/testing purposes
-- It will be run when you execute: supabase db reset

-- Note: In a real application, you would typically seed this with test data
-- For now, we'll leave it empty as chats and messages will be created by users

-- Example seed data (commented out):
-- INSERT INTO public.chats (user_id, title) VALUES
--   ('user-uuid-here', 'Test Chat 1'),
--   ('user-uuid-here', 'Test Chat 2');
